# Whatsthematter is the fruition of a single thought that passed through my head while I was studying for an Organic Chemistry test in Grade 12:

# "What if I could make a program to do this for me?"

# I applied all the knowledge I had of the Python language to achieve my goal of creating a program that could provide nomenclature of organic compounds. While very humble, I developed my critical thinking and problem solving skills as I tirelessly fiddled with the code until I was happy with its complexity and accuracy. One day, I plan to make Whatsthematter a proper website with HTML, CSS, and Javascript so that one can look up an organic formula and get a mini Wikipedia description of the molecule.
